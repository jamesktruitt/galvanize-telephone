## Functional
The home page includes:
* [ ] An `li` for each character that includes:
  * [ ] An `img` tag that renders the character's image
  * [ ] A `span` tag that displays the character's name and phone number
  * [ ] A `p` tag that displays the character's Message
  * [ ] An `a` tag that says 'Leave `${character.name}` a Message' and when clicked takes the user to the `contact.html` page for that user

The contact page includes:
* [ ] A form with
  * [ ] The character's name pre-populated with the `character` value from the query string
  * [ ] A way for the user to enter a message
  * [ ] A submit button that sends the name and message data to an external API
  * [ ] A status message area that displays "Message received!" when a name and message are present, and "Your request wasn't formatted correctly; are you stuck in the upside-down?" when either is missing

## Code Style
* [ ] Functions are small and readable
* [ ] Correct indentation
* [ ] Consistent semi-colon usage
* [ ] Descriptive names
* [ ] No `console.log` statements
